# BanisherBot
Banisher bot does exactly what it sounds like: it banishes people.

It has been designed for a single server & I don't plan on making it work on multiple servers at once.
It's main commands are banish and shuffle. Banish banishes someone for X amount of times (keeps them out of the Discord channel they were last in) where X < 10.

Shuffle moves someone around for X amount of times where X < 10.

There's also some other functions like moveall, rng & flip. Moveall moves ppl from X channel(s) to a specified channel. Currently does not work with channels that include a space in their name but I plan on chaging that soon.

Rng generates a random number between X and Y. If X isn't specified, X = 0.

Flip flips a coin.
